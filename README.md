# Design-of-a-Step-Up-DC-DC-Boost-Converter
Designed a step-up, non-isolated DC-DC Boost converter with specific power requirements, including 50W output power and 48V output
voltage. Utilized the PWM controller UC3843AN from Texas Instruments, ensuring stable operation with a switching frequency of 125 kHz.
Designed the PCB using Altium Designer and personally soldered all components to complete the converter. Conducted simulations and
hardware testing to verify compliance with specifications, such as a voltage ripple limit of 2.4V and maintaining continuous conduction
mode (CCM) operation
